# Biorhythm

Python script which will calculate the Biorhythms for an individual and present the data graphically using libraries and a common algorithm.

Humans have rhythms like the ocean and rhythms are any regular recurring motion. Biorhythms are an initiative used to predict various aspects of peopleâ€™s life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century.

The theory underlying Biorhythms proposes that, from birth, three cycles: physical, emotional and intellectual affect our performance. Understanding these cycles can help to optimise our potential.
